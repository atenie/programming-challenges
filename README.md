## Synopsis
Small, mostly console-oriented programs for the sake of variety to my programming learning experience.

## What I've learned
* 001->012 Have been basic things I've done in my beginner attempts at understanding various small concepts. All C++. I haven't bothered with 011, and doubt I'll end up bothering with it any time soon.
* 013 Has been one of my more difficult projects in university, as it meant programming on my Ubuntu machine a CRUD/MVC in C++ with basic CSV file management, Qt GUI and code coverage that I've done via lcov.
* 014 Has been a small bash scripting exercise I wanted to do in order to have a better grasp at it.
* 015 Is a database manager and part of what I've learned in my Java courses at university, with support for .csv files and SQL databases.
* 016 Is a half-working Pacman clone with a GUI in JavaFX. Part of the challenge was rendering the map only by using Streams.
* 017 Is a half-working 2048 webapp clone, using a Tomcat server and with basic JSF/XHTML code for the frontend side.
