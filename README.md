# tomato-pie: A bash shell Pomodoro timer script

## Synopsis
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), the Pomodoro technique is a time management method. This is a bash shell script for tomato-loving time managers.

## Motivation
I like to use the Pomodoro technique to practice some form of self-discipline. Now you can use it too.
Good luck, working Padawan. Tomato pies await you.

## Installation and usage
Copy it in `/usr/bin`, run `tomato-pie` in your terminal. Run `tomato-pie -d` if you want to use the default schedule with four 25 mins. work sessions with 5 mins. small breaks and a large 15 mins. break at the end.  Select `y` or `n` if you want to go again or not.

## Issues
This project isn't yet POSIX-compatible, so if you want to run it in Debian/Ubuntu, expect stuff to not work.
